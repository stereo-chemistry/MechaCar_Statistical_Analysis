## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Vehicle length and ground clearance variables both provide non-random amounts of variance to the MPG values in this dataset. this is determined with reference to the p values **Pr(>|t|)** for each variable. Vehicle length and ance ground clearance list **Pr(>|t|)** values less than 0.05, suggesting statistical significant relationship with the dependent variable MPG.
### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
